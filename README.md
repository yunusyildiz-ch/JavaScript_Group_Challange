# 🎮 Powercoders JavaScript Group Challenge

Welcome to the **JavaScript Group Challenge** at Powercoders Bootcamp!  
In this challenge, we’ll use our JavaScript knowledge to build a simple but creative text-based game using only basic browser interaction tools. 💻✨

## 📋 Task Overview

> 💡 **Goal:**  
Build a browser-based game inspired by the earlier CLI group challenge — using only your JavaScript skills and creativity!

> 🤝 **Group work:**  
Teams of **3 people** will plan, build, test, and present the game together.

## 📌 Challenge Instructions

✔️ Create a game using **only `prompt()` and `alert()`** for user interaction  
✔️ No HTML elements or DOM manipulation  
✔️ Make use of core JavaScript features:
- `if/else` statements

- Arrays and Objects  
- Functions  
- `setTimeout()` or `confirm()` (optional)

✔️ Use **GitHub** for collaboration and version control  
✔️ Start with planning & **pseudocode**  
✔️ Prepare a clear **5-minute presentation**
