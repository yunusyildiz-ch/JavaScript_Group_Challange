# 🎮 Powercoders JavaScript Group Challenge

Welcome to the **JavaScript Group Challenge** at Powercoders Bootcamp!  
In this challenge, we’ll use our JavaScript knowledge to build a simple but creative text-based game using only basic browser interaction tools. 💻✨

---

## 📋 Task Overview

> 💡 **Goal:**  
Build a browser-based game inspired by the earlier CLI group challenge — using only your JavaScript skills and creativity!

> 🤝 **Group work:**  
Teams of **3 people** will plan, build, test, and present the game together.

---

## 📌 Challenge Instructions

✔️ Create a game using **only `prompt()` and `alert()`** for user interaction  
✔️ No HTML elements or DOM manipulation  
✔️ Make use of core JavaScript features:
- `if/else` statements  
- `for` / `while` loops  
- Arrays and Objects  
- Functions  
- `setTimeout()` or `confirm()` (optional)

✔️ Use **GitHub** for collaboration and version control  
✔️ Start with planning & **pseudocode**  
✔️ Prepare a clear **5-minute presentation**  

---

## 🗣️ Presentation Guidelines

In your 5-minute presentation, cover the following:

- 🎯 **Goal of the game**  
- 📏 **Rules**  
- ⚙️ **What JavaScript concepts were used?**  
- 🔧 **What challenges did you face?**  
- 💬 **Give and receive feedback** to/from another group

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. ✅ Plan your game idea as a group  
2. 🧠 Write pseudocode before coding  
3. 👨‍💻 Start coding collaboratively using GitHub  
4. 🎤 Prepare your demo and presentation  
5. 📦 Submit your game repository with a working `README.md`

# And Our Game 🎮

## 🤖 Data Center Breakout: Rogue AI

A text-based JavaScript adventure game created for the **Powercoders JavaScript Group Challenge**.  
No HTML, no UI — just pure logic, randomness, and classic `prompt()`/`alert()` interaction in the browser console!

---

### 🎯 Game Goal

You are a systems engineer trapped inside a malfunctioning data center controlled by a rogue AI.  
Your mission is to explore rooms, solve logic puzzles, collect tools, and escape…  
Before the AI locks you inside forever. 🧠🔒

---

### 🕹️ Gameplay Overview

- Navigate through **three unique rooms**: Power Grid, Cooling Room, and AI Core.
- Each room presents a randomly selected **challenge** from:
  - Logic puzzles 🧩
  - Math riddles ➕➗
  - Memory tests 🧠
  - Code-breaking problems 🔓
- Pass challenges to collect tools or the keycard.
- Skip or fail too often, and you'll fall into traps or get locked out.
- Use your **inventory** wisely to escape at the end!

---

### 📏 Rules

- Interaction only through `prompt()` and `alert()` – no HTML or buttons
- Random challenges, random risks – no two runs are the same
- Retry failed challenges once, or accept defeat
- You need the **Keycard** (from AI Core) to unlock the final door
- Game ends in either **victory** or **trap-lock failure**

---

### 🛠️ JavaScript Concepts Used

✅ Functions  
✅ Arrays & Objects  
✅ Loops & Conditionals  
✅ Randomized logic (`Math.random()`)  
✅ Prompt/Alert-based user input  
✅ Inventory management  
✅ Branching outcomes and retries  
✅ Clean and readable modular structure

---

### 🧠 What You’ll Learn

By reading, running, or modifying this project, you will strengthen your understanding of:

- How to build interactive games using only JavaScript and browser prompts
- Designing game logic with clean functions and conditions
- Managing game state using arrays and objects
- Working with randomness to create dynamic experiences
- Creating decision-based storylines with retry systems and win/lose conditions
- Structuring code for reusability and clarity

---

### 🏆 Play, Think, Escape!

> Will you outsmart the AI or become just another locked-down engineer?  
> **Try your luck. Solve the puzzles. Escape the Data Center.**

Good luck, adventurer — may your browser guide you well. 🚀
